# dae-factuality

**UPDATE: Models in this repo measure factuality for single sentence source sentences. For longer source docuemnts (e.g. XSum/CnnDm articles), please refer to our follow-up work https://github.com/tagoyal/factuality-datasets**

Code for paper "Evaluating Factuality in Generation with Dependency-level Entailment" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05478.pdf

Environment base is Python 3.6. Also see requirements.txt. We used Stanford CoreNLP version 3.9.1.

# Models and Data
They can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16NEL8T-JvhJPy7miVUbMELVE8ZOTYGit?usp=sharing

There are 3 models in the above folder:

dae: model trained on only the paraphrase data, without synonym augmentation or hallucinations

dae_w_syn (this model used in experimts in Section 6 onwards): trained on paraphrase data + synonym data

dae_w_syn_w_hallu: trained on paraphrase data + synonym data + hallucination data

# Evaluation
To evaluate the model on your own data (or that in resources folder), run the evaluate_factuality script. This relies on the stanford CoreNLP server to parse the output and obtain it's dependency parse. 

1) Run the coreNLP server. We used Stanford CoreNLP version 3.9.1 (can be downloaded from https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/history.html). Run the following command (from the stanford corenlp parser folder): 
```
java -mx4g -cp "*" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer
```
2) Next, run the evaluation scipt with the appropriate pointers to model directory and input: 
```
python evaluate_factuality.py --model_type electra_dae --input_dir [model_dir] --test_type [summ/para]
```
